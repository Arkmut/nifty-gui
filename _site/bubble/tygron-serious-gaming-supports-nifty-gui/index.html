<title>Tygron Serious Gaming supports Nifty GUI! &#8211; Nifty GUI</title>
<meta name="description" content="Everything started when I was answering a question on the regular jMonkeyEngine3 Nifty GUI support forum&lt;&#47;a&gt; and some questions somewhere in the comment section of this Nifty GUI blog. Someone had build a converter to convert Java Swing GUIs into Nifty GUI XML files. Interesting!
As it turned out these posts were related to each other and were both coming from the same gaming company Tygron Serious Gaming&lt;&#47;a&gt; located in The Hague, The Netherlands. A couple of emails later we've identified some things that they'd like to be improved as well as other things to be added to Nifty. Since some of their existing game assets relied on the direct display of HTML data - which Nifty did not supported - they were especially interested in adding basic HTML support to Nifty.
Everything was very friendly and they especially made it clear from the very beginning that they had no interest in messing with Niftys "openness" in any way. That means that everything we'd change or add to Nifty will still be available for free without any added restrictions. I think this is not something that you can take for granted when dealing with a corporation. So in general that is a very nice attitude! Kudos for them for this!
To discuss all of this in more detail they've invited me to The Hague and suddenly I was sitting in a train to the Netherlands to meet everyone involved in the project. Travelling to discuss Nifty related things in a meeting! Amazing!
:D
As expected everybody was nice and friendly. Marieke - their Office Manager - did an excellent job in organizing my travel and Raymond made sure that I've ended up at the right place.
Here is a little group photo they did. Look for me in a dark gray shirt in the middle of the picture.

It was really amazing to see Nifty being used in commercial software running on their big screen in the conference room! And seeing the Java Swing to Nifty GUI converter in action was quite amazing as well!
:D 
So what do you, as a Nifty User, get out of this collaboration? Basically two things: 
- Niftys memory overhead has been greatly reduced. Nifty is now a lot more GC friendly (improved FPS too)
- The HTML Module&lt;&#47;a&gt; is now available and will be a part of Nifty 1.3.1. This adds basic HTML support to Nifty which allows you to generate Nifty elements from basic (!) HTML data.
Well, exciting times for Nifty GUI!
So, I'd like to take this opportunity to (again) thank Maxim, Jeroen and especially Raymond and William for the invitation and of course Marieke for the whole organisation!
Thank you Tygron!
