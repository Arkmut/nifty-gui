    The original 1.x Nifty style used the following gradient in Photoshop. However it was flipped and scaled by 123%.

    We could actually reproduce this in Nifty 2.x using the methods setScale(1.23) and setFlip() in the
    NiftyLinearGradient class - a pretty cool feature btw =)

    But since we'd really like to use the pure CSS3 syntax in here for the gradient but that doesn't support scaling or
    flipping of the gradient we calculated the corresponding flipped gradient and use that instead.

    Consider this comment as a note from the past or something :)

    Original photoshop gradient in Nifty 1.x: linear-gradient(#737373, #343434 37%, #000000 40%, #000000 44%, #343434);
   */

  background-gradient: linear-gradient(#343434 -23%, #000000 45.8%, #000000 50.8%, #343434 54.5%, #737373);
}
